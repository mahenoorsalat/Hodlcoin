The hodlCoin game is a competitive zero-sum massively multiplayer financial game where the goal is to hodl an asset for long periods of time. By hodling, a player deposits coins of a given asset in a common reserve and receives a proportional amount of hodlCoins. Players who un-hodl pay a fee that is accumulated in the common reserve. Thus, the longer a player hodls, in comparison with other players, the more the player will benefit from fees paid by the players who are un-hodling earlier. Surprisingly, thanks to the accumulation of fees, the price of hodlCoins in comparison with the underlying asset never decreases.
